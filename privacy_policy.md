# Privacy Policy for SpareBro

**Last Updated:** 15.11.2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Maksym Slobodianyk ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of the SpareBro mobile application (the "Service").

Your privacy is a top priority for us. Our guiding principle is to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve the Service.

## Data Controller

The "Data Controller" (the entity responsible for your data) for the Service is:

- **Name:** Maksym Slobodianyk
- **Registered Seat:**
- **ID No. (IČO):**
- **Contact Email:** sparesbro.app@gmail.com

As we are based in the Czech Republic, your data is protected by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Our Privacy-First Approach

We designed SpareBro to be private. We do not have a user account system, and we do not have access to your personal item data.

- **Essential (Free) Version:** All your data (item names, stock levels, replacement history) is stored only on your device. We cannot see, read, or access this information.

- **Unlimited (Paid) Version:** If you upgrade, you have the option to sync your data using Apple's iCloud service. This sync is managed by Apple and is tied to your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to your Apple ID or any of the data stored in your iCloud.

## 2. What Data We Collect (and Why)

We collect two types of information: "User Content" (which we cannot access) and "Analytics Data" (which we use to improve the app).

### A. User Content (We CANNOT Access This)

This is the data you create in the app.

- **What it is:** Item names, emoji icons, stock levels, replacement schedules (time-based or usage-based), and replacement history.

- **How it's used:** This data is used by the app locally on your device to perform its core functions: tracking your items, managing your stock, and sending you reminders (local notifications).

- **Where it's stored:** On your device (Essential) or in your personal iCloud (Unlimited).

### B. Analytics Data (To Improve the App)

To understand how our app is being used, identify bugs, and improve features, we use a third-party analytics service, PostHog.

**What it is:** This is anonymous or pseudonymous usage data. It may include:

- **App Events:** Such as when you add an item, complete onboarding, or use a feature.
- **Device Information:** Your device model, iOS version, and country.
- **Performance Data:** Crash reports and information on app speed.

**What it is NOT:** Our analytics are configured to never collect the personal content you enter. We do not log your item names, history, or stock counts. The data is about how you use the app, not what you are tracking.

**Our Legal Basis:** We collect this data based on our "legitimate interest" to maintain and improve the Service.

### C. In-App Purchase Data

The "Unlimited Version" is a one-time in-app purchase processed by Apple. We do not collect, see, or store your credit card information or payment details. We only receive an anonymous confirmation (a "token") from Apple that a purchase was completed.

## 3. How We Share Your Data

We do not sell, rent, or trade your data with anyone. We only share data with the following third-party services as necessary to operate the app.

### Apple

- To process payments for the one-time In-App Purchase.
- To provide the iCloud synchronization feature if you are an "Unlimited" user.

### PostHog

- To provide us with the anonymous analytics data described in Section 2B. You can read PostHog's Privacy Policy at https://posthog.com/privacy.

## 4. Your Data Rights (GDPR)

Because we are based in the EU, you have specific rights over your data.

- **Right to Access, Rectify, and Erase:** You have full control over your User Content. Because this data is stored on your device or in your iCloud, you can access, edit, and delete it at any time directly within the SpareBro app.

- **Right to Object (Analytics):** You have the right to object to our collection of analytics data. You can disable this data collection at any time from the "Settings" menu within the SpareBro app.

- **Right to Lodge a Complaint:** If you believe we are not handling your data correctly, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. The relevant authority in the Czech Republic is the Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů (Office for Personal Data Protection).

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the limited analytics data we collect. The security of your personal User Content is handled by the built-in security of your device (iOS) and, if applicable, your Apple iCloud account.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take steps to remove that information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our App Store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
