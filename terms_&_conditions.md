Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

**By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.** If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.

## 1. The Service

SpareBro provides a tool to help users track and manage consumable items that require regular replacement. The Service allows you to log items, track stock levels, set replacement schedules (time-based or usage-based), and receive reminders.

The Service is offered in two versions:

- **Essential Version:** A free version that allows you to track a limited number of items (one item).
- **Unlimited Version:** A paid version, unlocked via a one-time in-app purchase, which allows you to track unlimited items and enables data synchronization via Apple's iCloud service.

## 2. In-App Purchase

The "Unlimited Version" is an optional upgrade available as a one-time in-app purchase.

All payments are processed through the Apple App Store, from which you originally downloaded the application. You agree to comply with all terms and conditions of the App Store. All purchases are final and non-refundable. Any refund requests or issues with payment must be directed to Apple, as we do not manage the transaction or have the ability to process refunds.

## 3. User-Generated Content (Your Data)

You are solely responsible for all data, information, item names, history logs, stock counts, and other content ("User Content") that you create or input into the Service.

You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. You grant us a limited, non-exclusive license solely to host, store, and display your User Content on your device (and in your personal iCloud account, if you purchase the Unlimited Version) for the sole purpose of providing the Service's functionality to you.

We are not responsible for the loss, corruption, or accuracy of your User Content. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups.

## 4. iCloud Synchronization

The "Unlimited Version" of the Service offers an optional feature to synchronize your User Content across your Apple devices using Apple's iCloud service.

This feature is provided "as is" and "as available." Your use of iCloud is subject to Apple's terms of service. We are not responsible for any data loss, synchronization errors, service interruptions, or other issues related to iCloud.

## 5. License and Restrictions

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service on any Apple-branded product that you own or control, as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

You agree not to:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service.
- Copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Service.
- Rent, lease, lend, sell, or sublicense the Service.
- Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.

## 6. Disclaimers and No Warranty

The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without any warranties of any kind, express or implied.

**Important:** The Service is an informational tool only. We do not warrant that the Service will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that its reminders will be 100% accurate or timely. You are solely responsible for remembering to replace your items. You should not rely solely on the Service's reminders for critical, safety-related, or high-value items (e.g., medical supplies, car parts, or safety equipment).

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any damages or losses (including property damage, personal injury, or financial loss) resulting from a missed, late, or incorrect replacement, regardless of whether a reminder failed to function correctly.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall Maksym Slobodianyk, nor our affiliates, partners, or employees, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of data, loss of profits, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service.

Our total liability to you for all claims arising from or related to the Service is limited to the amount you paid for the one-time in-app purchase to unlock the "Unlimited Version".

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Czech Republic, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in the Czech Republic.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice (e.g., via an in-app notification) before new terms take effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
